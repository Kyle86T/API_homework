# python_api_challenge


Had more time to work on this assignment. Had help from Gunjan and google.
Was not able to do linear regression models, as I skipped them in the first place and didn't get back to them
Basically the max temp by latitude shows  that  the closer you are to 0 Lat (equator), statistically speaking the temperatures rise.
Was hard to tell if there was a correlation with lat and humidity, strictly by the scatter plot.
Not sure I did the hotel part correctly.

Not sure why anyone would do this in the first place, as Milan is the most beautiful place in the world. Highly reccomend.
